# NLP-Driven Analysis of Dramatic Literature

This repository contains the codebase for applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to explore the linguistic intricacies and emotional landscapes in the works of Samuel Beckett and Bernard-Marie Koltès. The project utilizes various computational methods to reveal patterns in language and emotion, providing new insights into these plays' narrative depth and dramatic tension.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections, corresponding to the papers where these analyses were applied:
- **Beckett**: Code for analyzing the emotional and linguistic structures in *Not I* by Samuel Beckett.
- **Koltes**: Code for examining emotional arcs and linguistic features in Bernard-Marie Koltès’ plays.

## Key Features
- Word frequency analysis and visualizations.
- Emotion detection using transformer-based models.
- Repetitive motif detection for analyzing narrative rhythm and structure.
- Sentiment and dramatic tension analysis over time.

## Papers
- *I or Not I: Unraveling the Linguistic Echoes of Identity in Samuel Beckett’s 'Not I' Through Natural Language Processing*
- *Traversing Emotional Landscapes and Linguistic Patterns in Bernard-Marie Koltès’ Plays: An NLP Perspective*
